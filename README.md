**Course:** Django + React  
**Batch:** 6  
**Assignment:** Module 6 – Project 1 & Project 2  
**Topic:** Simple Calculator & Number Guessing Game  

---

## 📘 Overview

This assignment includes two Python command-line applications designed to strengthen fundamental programming concepts such as **functions, loops, conditional statements, and error handling**.

Both programs are run in the **terminal** and do not require any external libraries.

## 🧩 Project 1: Simple Calculator

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a CLI-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  
- Modulus  

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- Functions  
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- User input handling  
- Exception handling (`try-except`)  

### ⚙️ Program Flow
1. The program displays a list of operations.  
2. The user selects an operation by entering a choice (1–5).  
3. Two numbers are entered as inputs.  
4. The result of the chosen operation is displayed.  
5. Division by zero and invalid inputs are properly handled.

## 🎮 Project 2: Number Guessing Game

### 🎯 Objective
Create an interactive number guessing game where:
- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
- The user attempts to guess the number.  
- The program provides hints (“Too high” or “Too low”) until the correct number is guessed.  

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- Random number generation (`random` module)  
- Loops (`while True`)  
- Conditional statements  
- Input validation and error handling  

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program randomly selects a secret number (1–100).  
2. The user repeatedly guesses the number.  
3. Feedback is provided after each guess.  
4. The game ends when the correct number is guessed, showing total attempts.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (version 3.8 or later).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Run each script using:
   ```bash```
python calculator.py
